# Hack-to-Hack Co-work: To Prague from Berlin

## Intro

We propose the concept of a co-work space in Prague, Czech Republic from 27-30 May, for hackers to bridge the gap between two hackathons on adjacent weekends: ETHBerlin (24-26 May) and ETHPrague (31 May to 2 June). We aim to empower international collaboration at the crossroads of east and west, and kick-off the summer of buidling in 2024.
Milestones in terms of putting on the event are:

- Securing general support from community
- Selecting a venue in Prague
- Securing overall funding (estimated at between $20k and $50k - dependent on venue and capacity)
- Announce the concept, and start accepting applications to attend

Hack-to-Hack is an initiative to empower interoperability between hackers, and between hackathons. It aims to use open source and decentralised systems for management of all data submitted by participants, and to uphold an individual's self-sovereignty throughout the participation in the event.

Such an initiative has inevitable real-world costs. We aim to keep these as lean as possible, while providing a comfortable environment for collaborating, hacking, and enjoying. Costs largely relate to rental of a location, and tables / chairs / power / internet, to provide basic needs for a hacking co-work. We propose to provide minimal catering, and instead to inform participants about local options for food and drink, as a way to encourage hackers to get to know the city of Prague.
